##### About my project

- I am using `React` with `Redux` library on the frontend & also using `firebase` library for the ease of communicating to my Firebase database.
  For keeping all of the users' "collection shopping cart" I used `redux-persist` library in order to save the redux store in their local storage. For the styling I went with the `styled-components` library as their _CSS-in-JS_ technique is a good choice to avoid CSS leaking globally.
- On the backend - server is built in `Node.js` with `Express` library. I am using `Firebase firestore` as the NoSQL database & also using their Google authentication provider.
